what do i even put here? i don't really know. why are you reading this? not entirely sure, but hello.

## Why?

curiosity? yes. boredom? yes. unemployment? yes. SELF PRESERVATION? UHUH.

## What is this?

i guess i thought i'd document my progress as i attempt to learn more about computers doing weird shit with math- with a focus on the how.

## Who are you.

recent software eng graduate. not very smart. horrible at math. addicted to valorant (sad).

## Plan?

i don't have one. i'm winging it. i kinda have an idea of where to start, we'll go from there i guess?

### What next?

- **learn things**: me trying to make sense of things..?
- **trial and error, mostly error**: yes.
- **maybe i'll have a moment or two**: maybe sometimes i can figure things out? i hope.
- **lots of chatgpt**: chatgpt knows everything, or atleast more than i do.

## Again. WHY?

i guess i'm here to learn out loud. i have alot of trouble seeing things through, following up on projects without a looming deadline (uni assignments), so i figured this could be a fun way to maybe keep me honest.

**i know im dumb, but i'm doing this because i want to try. ðŸ¤·**

cool.
